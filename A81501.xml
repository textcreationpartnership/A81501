         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this, the ſame Biſhop <hi>Carleton,</hi> in the ſame Book, p. 2. ſaith,
That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches are viſible Aſſemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
Governed by divers viſible heads, and proves it by <hi>Gregory, Lib.</hi> 4.
<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. —</p>
            <p>A fourth Church, in Scripture Phraſe, cannot be found (ſince
the time that all in every Nation which fear God are accepted, as the Apoſtle
ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35.) Such as National, Provincial, Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> We read not in Scripture, nor in any Church Hiſtory for many
years after Chriſt, of any Church, diſtinct from theſe Deſcriptions
before given.</p>
            <p>Now, it is to be preſumed, that there are none who will affirm,
that the firſt of theſe three Churches could poſſibly meet together, or
do any Act, as a Church, either in chooſing Officers, determining
Controverſies, Ordering things indifferent to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, giving
Interpretations of Scriptures, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Ordinances, and caſting out of
Offenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or that ever any ſuch Power was derived down from
Chriſt upon them, as a Church ſo to do; or that he ever intended this
Church, when he <pb n="6" facs="tcp:172259:4"/> directs any thing to be done by the Church
as ſuch; becauſe of the utter impoſſibility of their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
thereof, as a Church, part of which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fallen aſleep, and part
not yet born.</p>
            <p>Alſo it may be concluded, as to the ſecond Church above
deſcribed, that it is utterly impoſſible they ſhould at any time meet
together as a Church in one Body, to agree upon, conſent unto, Act, or Order
any thing (according to the power given to the Churches, as above) joyntly as
ſuch a Church; or partake of Ordinances joyntly as ſuch. Nay, it's
improbable, if not impoſſible, that in their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, this Church
ſhould meet, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a capacity, to Act as a Church in any
of the things to be done by a Church as ſuch. Nay, was there ever any ſuch
meeting of this Church? None as can be found in Story. Or, if this were
poſſible, where have we Authority of Scripture or Primitive Practice, to
juſtifie ſuch a Company of Repreſentatives, to call themſelves a Church
in this ſence, and to take to themſelves the Power of the whole Church
given to her by Jeſus Chriſt, and to call their Acts the Acts of the
Church? And it would be ſtrange for any to affirm, that Chriſt hath put the
Power (as to the Execution of it) into the hands of a Body that can never
poſſibly be able to Execute the Power derived upon.</p>
            <p>If any number of Men would colourably make themſelves the
Churches Repreſentative: It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould be choſen by
the whole, and ſome one at leaſt for every particular Church, Body,
Society, or Congregation throughout the World; as the Meſſengers of the
Churches were choſen by the Churches, or elſe how in any tolerable
ſenſe, can they be ſaid to be the Church, in either of the two firſt
Deſcriptions?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:172259:4"/>And then ſurely it will follow, That all the
Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that by the Scripture is placed in the Church of God, as ſuch, (as to
the Execution thereof) is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived upon the particular Churches, Societies, or
Congregations for the management of Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within themſelves, as to
Meeting, the Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Circumſtances of Worſhip, caſting out of
Offenders, chooſing Officers, Ordering things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
according to the Laws of Chriſt given us in Precept, or Example of Scripture,
and practice of pureſt times; and the determination of theſe things is
given to each Church, the ſame Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the ſame Rule. The

that the Spirit of God is not tyed to places, nor to numbers of Men; tell it to

it was each Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Liberty to joyn himſelf to what Society, Church, or
Number of Chriſtians he pleaſed, or was moſt convenient for him: And that
it was the Churches power to admit ſuch who deſired ſo to joyn unto them:
And that this Liberty continued to particular Churches and Chriſtians many

               </note> we think none can deny; if they do, let them ſhew

nor in ſome Ages after, to confine Men to joyn themſelves to, or continue
with this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church or Society, or to this or that Church ſo
and ſo formed and Governed. No, nor can we find any ſuch Law made by any of
the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperors, but ſtill left free. It was thus alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> That the Diviſion of Pariſhes was firſt
made by the People, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Inhabitants, having received the
Faith, built a Temple for the Exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, hired a Prieſt,
and did conſtitute a Church; <pb n="9" facs="tcp:172259:5"/> which by the Neighbours was
called a Pariſh; and when the Numbers were increaſed, if one Church and
Prieſt were not ſufficient, thoſe who were moſt remote did build a
Church beſide, and fit themſelves better. <hi>Hiſt. Conc. Trident.
Lib.</hi> 6. p. 498.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum</hi> affirms,
That Men are not bound by the Law of Nature to aſſociate themſelves with
any but whom they ſhall think fit: And that every one entring into a Society,
ſhould conſent and ſubmit unto the Rules of it; which (ſaith he) at
mens firſt entring into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of a Church, was requiſite to be done
by the expreſs and explicite conſent of the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being
capable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for Children, he ſaith, That it is highly
rational, that when they come to Age, they ſhould explicitly declare their
own voluntary conſent to ſubmit to the Laws of Chriſt, and conform
themſelves to the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; which, ſaith he, might
be a probable way, and certainly moſt agreeable both to Reaſon and
Scripture, to advance the Credit of Chriſtianity once more in the World,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That one great cauſe of the flouriſhing of Religion in the
Primitive times, was certainly the ſtrictneſs uſed by them in their
admiſſion of Members into their Church-So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. Theſe are Mr.
<hi>Stillingfleets</hi> own words, ſee them in p. 132. 134. And as to the
Churches admittance of Members, and of ſuch as joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the ſame
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſaith, in the ſame Book, <hi>p.</hi> 134, 135. That
none were admitted but ſuch, into whoſe Lives and Carriages they had
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to diſcern their ſeriouſneſs in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of
Chriſtianity, and find true Repentance and Reformation of Life, a
profeſſion of Faith, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Life to the Goſpel, without which
it was <pb n="10" facs="tcp:172259:6"/> not Lawful to admit them; and this he proves there
by <hi>Origen, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> &amp;c. And as to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Covenant,
by ſuch, he ſaith, That if by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Covenant be meant a real
conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who joyn themſelves together in
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances in Order to their being a Church, he koweth none will
queſtion it, that knoweth what it is that maketh a Society to be ſo, which
is ſuch a real conſideration with one another. Again, That though every
Chriſtian be bound to joyn with ſome Society, or Church, yet not being
determined by Scripture to what particular Church they ſhould joyn;
therefore, ſaith he, (for Chriſtians better underſtanding what their
mutual Duty is one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is their Paſtor, to whom they owe the
Relation of Members) That there ſhould be ſome ſignificant Declaration
either by their Words or Actions of their willingneſs to joyn with ſuch a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Society in Goſpel-Ordinances:<note place="margin">Mr.
<hi>Vines</hi> upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>p.</hi> 322, 323 324.</note> This he
grants to be neceſſary too. And further, That when Churches are over-run
with Looſeneſs, Ignorance, and Prophaneneſs; this is uſeful, ſaith
he, if not neceſſary. Yea, that at all times it ſeems the moſt likely
way to advance the Practice, Power, and Purity of Religion. See it more at
large, p. 138. 140.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That though the Law of God or Nature hath not,
yet that there are Laws of Men that do determine the Matter as to the
particular Churches, to which every Member muſt joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (to wit) to
the Pariſh wherein each Member reſides for the time being; and alſo, as
to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of joyning and being admitted, (that is) by their being
Pariſhioners.</p>

this Church in general, that they did affect <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and would
have Elected him to be their Biſhop, and then he perſwades them to 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:172259:8"/> chooſe another, ſeeing all did not agree, therefore,
ſaith he, not Lawful; becauſe, ſaith he, he that is Elected to a
Biſhoprick by the general Suffrage of Wiſe men aſſembled to deliberate
thereof, ought by Gods Law to enjoy it. This is Recorded in
<hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> of the Life of <hi>Conſtantine, Lib.</hi> 3.

<hi>p.</hi> 225. (Speaking about ſome who might be in a Capacity of being

them, they may Succeed the Deceaſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it's
manifeſt by the ſame Hiſtory, That where any one Congregation did divide

by the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> they divided themſelves from the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
and choſe to themſelves Biſhops, and Aſſembled alone.</p>
            <p>And it is obſervable, That all theſe Biſhops thus choſen
and appointed of the People of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, were ſtill
acknowledged as Lawful Biſhops by all; and in all the Councels mentioned in

And after, in p. 282. The Biſhop affirms, that <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in the

quotes <hi>Tertul. Exhort. Caſtil. c.</hi> 7. for theſe words, That all the
difference between the Miniſters and People, comes from the Churches
Authority; and again, p. 416. himſelf ſaith, That Epiſcopal men will
hardly find any evidence in Scripture, or the Practice of the Apoſtles, for
Churches conſiſting of many fixed Congregations for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, under the
Charge of one man; nor in the Primitive Church for the Ordination of Biſhops 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172259:10"/> without the preceding Election of the Clergy, <hi>and at
least, conſent,</hi> and <hi>approbation of the People;</hi> ſo much he
allows there, and ſomething more in p. 339. where he uſeth theſe words
(ſpeaking of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) now the voyce <hi>of the People, which was uſed in
the Primitive times,</hi> is grown out of uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which he
confeſſeth it to be the Primitive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. But Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
having (as he ſaith) been at the pains to tranſcribe ſome of Biſhop
<hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s words, they will ſerve well here, and we ſhall again
tranſcribe ſo much of them as ſpeaks to this particular. See them in the
ſame <hi>Irenicum,</hi> p. 391, 392. They are theſe. That in the Apoſtles
time, when there were no Chriſtian Princes, by whoſe Authority Miniſters
of Gods Word might be appointed, nor ſins be corrected by the Sword; there
was no Remedy then for correction of Vice, or appointment of Miniſters, but
only the conſent of Chriſtian Multitude amongſt themſelves by an
uniform conſent to follow the Advice and perſwaſion of ſuch Perſons
whom God had moſt endued with the Spirit of Wiſdom and Councel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Apoſtles, and others unto, whom God had given
abundance of his Spirit, ſent, or appointed Miniſters of Gods Word;
ſometimes the People did chooſe ſuch as they thought meet thereunto: and
when any were ſent by the Apoſtles, or other, the People, of their own
voluntary will, with thanks did accept of them, not for the Supremacy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Dominion that the Apoſtles had over them to command, as their Princes or
Maſters, but as good People, ready to Obey the good Councellors, and to
accept any thing neceſſary for their Edification and Benefit. And again,
that the People before Chriſtian Princes were, commonly did Elect 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172259:10"/> their Biſhops and Prieſts; thus far of Biſhop
<hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> which words of his (as Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> there
affirms) he put his own Hand to, and gave it in, in anſwer to certain
Queſtions put to him in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths Time, and now remain
upon Record.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in his
Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> p. 27. grants the Truth of
this. That the People did chooſe their Paſtors in the Primitive Ages of the
Church, in expreſs terms, and ſaith, it was taken away from the People by
Chriſtian Princes, when the Fathers diſliked the uſe. So far of him in
this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polanus,</hi> in his <hi>Sintagma, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi>

Churches.— Under this Head, <hi>De Electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ſeu vocationibu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſaith, That the Liberty, or Power of Election,
calling or ſending of Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is a Right, which the
whole Church hath in chooſing, and calling to themſelves approved and fit
Miniſters, and in placing them into Sacred Order, p. 542. After in his next
p. 543. under this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; <hi>a quibus Electio ſeu vocatio
Miniſtrorum Eccleſiae fieri debeat?</hi> By whom the Election, or calling
of Miniſters of the Church ought to be made? He ſaith, That unto the
Legitimate (or Lawful Election of the Miniſters of the Church, eſpecially
of the Paſtors,) is requiſite, a free and ingenious conſent, and Suffrage
of the whole Church (whoſe buſineſs it is) that is of the Elders and
Flock. The which conſent muſt not be had by intreaty, or ſold for a
price, much leſs forced and extorted; ſo that it is the part of the whole
Church, to chooſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for themſelves: And there he gives theſe 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172259:11"/> following arguments to evince it. Firſt, becauſe even
in the time of the Apoſtles, the whole Church (whoſe buſineſs it was)
did chooſe Miniſters for themſelves (or to it ſelf.) Neither did the
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves, ſaith he, Ordain any one for Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
charges, only by their own Authority, but always by the Church conſenting and
appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, &amp;c. and 14.23. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this
means the Churches own Liberty, which Chriſt hath given to it, is kept. For a
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, or Miniſter of the Word of God is not to be obtruded upon the
Church of God againſt his will. <hi>Can. Null. invit diſtinc.</hi> 61.
Thirdly, becauſe it ſerves to this, That even the Miniſters may, with a
good Conſcience, Rule the Lords Flock, by whom he is Elected; and the Flock
of the Lord may in like manner yield themſelves the more eaſie to him to be
Inſtructed and fed, than to him, who, beſide (or againſt) their will, is
thruſt upon them: and again, he is not to be acknowledged for a Lawful
Paſtor of the Church, who hath been intruded on the Church by the Authority
and Command of the Prince. <hi>Quod teſtatur Concil. Pariſienſe primum.
Can. Octavo Tomo Secundo Concil.</hi> And after he ſaith, in the ſame p.
That fit Perſons are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and preſented to the People before
the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and ſhould be openly propoſed in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. And
again, in <hi>p.</hi> 544. Under this Queſtion, <hi>Qualiter ſeu quomodo
Miniſtri Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Eligi &amp; vocari debeant?</hi> How the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Church ought to be choſen and called, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. Thoſe
Perſons are to be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, of whom the Election and Calling ought to be
made, to this end, that the Church by the free Suffrage of the whole
Congregation (or ſuch to <pb n="21" facs="tcp:172259:11"/> whom ſhe hath committed a
Right and Power of chooſing) may approve and accept of one of them.</p>
            <p>That the Suffrages are collected by ſome Paſtor of the Church,
or of another to whom he ſhall commit it. And they are given, either in Order
by every Elector, <hi>Vivâ voce,</hi> or joyntly of all or many, by
lifting up of hands, or either way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, if by giving their
Suffrages, <hi>Vivâ voce,</hi> there were variance, and they go into many
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of unprofitable and tedious prolixity, Thoſe who had any Votes for
Ordination were again named; and every one being named, they who choſe him
were commanded to lift up their Hands. At the Nomination of whom, either all or
many lifted up their Hands; this Man was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be Lawfully Elected.
After this manner, ſaith he, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did Create
Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23.</p>
            <p>And after, under this Queſtion, By what Rite or Ceremony?
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſaith, He who was Elected by the Church with free
Suffrages, at length receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ordination of the Paſtors of the Church, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. &amp; 5.22. the whole Multitude of the Church being
preſent. Then <hi>Polanus</hi> concludes with theſe words. They do
therefore grievouſly ſin who do manifeſtly drive away the
Eccleſiaſtical People or Flock from the Election of their Miniſters;
which, ſaith he, the falſe, or Counterfeit Popiſh Biſhops do; yea, they
do grievouſly ſin, who do impoſe Biſhops and Paſtors upon the Church
againſt their will. Thus far <hi>Polanus</hi> agrees in his own words.</p>
            <p>From ſome of the former Authorities, The <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
Synod, <hi>Athanaſius, Cornelius,</hi> and others. The Presbyterian Divines,
in their Book, called, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:172259:12"/> 
               <hi>Smectimnius,</hi> admits this
power to reſide in the People of particular Churches, and that by Divine
Authority. They ſay,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the eſpecial power of Judging of the Worthineſs,
or Unworthineſs lay in the People.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the power of chooſing, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them upon
this Judgment, reſided in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the power deſcended upon them by Divine Authority.
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſay they, in his <hi>Epiſt. ad Orthodoxos,</hi>
blamed the Intruſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as againſt the Apoſtolical Precepts,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> in his Book of un-biſhoping <hi>Timothy</hi>

quotes <hi>Jerome Epiſt.</hi> to <hi>Evagr.</hi> and his Comment upon
<hi>Titus,</hi> for this; That the Ancient Conſecration of Biſhops was
nothing elſe but their Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that all the Rites and
Ceremonies now uſed are but Novelties. And <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> for theſe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, in his afore-ſaid Book, and in his <hi>Scripta

191. and on <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. That impoſition of hands, on thoſe choſen
Miniſters belong to the Presbiters, but that this they have not Originally,
but only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, as Servants to the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that
this ought to be done publickly in the Church, where they are Elected before
all the Congregation: and that the impoſition of hands is no eſſential
part of Ordination,<note place="margin">Luther held this Concil Trident l. 7. p.
590.</note> but that it may be omitted. And that thoſe who are Elected, and
Lawfully called to the Miniſtry by the Suffrage of the whole Church and
People, are Miniſters Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called and Ordained without this Ceremony.
And Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> there further proves this by <hi>David Blond. Apol.
Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>de Ordinatione &amp; plebis in Electionibus jure,</hi> from
p. 309. to 448. He alſo affirms, p. 81. That <hi>Morney, Ameſius,</hi>

Biſhops refuſe to ordain as they ought, may Elect and Ordain Miniſters.
The right of Ordination and Election being Originally in the whole Church and

            <p>Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> p. 392.
where he tranſcribes Biſhop <hi>Cranmers</hi> anſwer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
before mentioned, hath ſet down theſe words amongſt others, as the
Biſhops own words. The Biſhop having affirmed, that the people before
Chriſtian Princes, did commonly Elect their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts, ſaith
further, That in the New-Teſtament, he that is appointed to be Prieſt or
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop needed no Conſecration, for Election, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment thereto
(ſaith he) is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:172259:13"/>Now, having ſo great a cloud of
witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception, and a concurrent ſentence in this
matter, by Perſons at ſo great a diſtance each from other in their
Judgment, in other things, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral ages of the World: It
ſeemeth ſtrange, that there ſhould be ſuch wreſtling againſt the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right of the Church of God; and ſuch a ſtir to make that Scripture,
<hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, than that, which ſo many

thoſe dayes. It's true in proceſs of time, ſtep by ſtep, forms of
prayer and preſcribed rules of worſhip crept in; or were thruſt in upon
the Churches, upon pretence at firſt, that by this, they might prevent the
ſpreading of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, which ſaid they, men might vent
in prayer if they had liberty to have prayed what they had pleaſed: therefore
they agreed, that Miniſters ſhould make their own form, and pray no other:
then after that, theſe forms ſhould not be uſed till he had conferred
with ſome of the able brethren of the Church whereof he was Miniſter: then,
the next ſtep was that this prayer muſt be approved of by a Council e're
they might uſe them: again, that one and the ſame form ſhould be uſed
in ſeveral Churches, as it is at this day, all which, ſuch as are
acquainted with Hiſtory, cannot deny. But from this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it was not
ſo from the beginning: and it is evident alſo that the power of managing of
the worſhip of Gods appointment (according as we ſee it was in thoſe
dayes) belonged to the particular Congregations and each did (as to the
circumſtances of theſe) as they judged moſt convenient, and tend moſt
to edification, nor did any other in thoſe days

and uſual in thoſe dayes, in their open Aſſemblies: yea when Biſhops

<hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> maintains and gives divers
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in thoſe days againſt one, who found fault only becauſe they
preached when Biſhops were preſent; not for their preaching only or
otherwiſe, yet this alſo they juſtifie, as that which was lawful and in

            <p>Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> againſt Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> (though
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt) yet he ſaith that Propheſying is expounding of Scripture and

come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church for Comfort and Edifying, to give into our Hearts,
and put into our Mouths what we ſhould Pray and Preach, and how we ſhould
handle the Scripture, then we might do it; and he <pb n="38" facs="tcp:172259:20"/> there
further ſaith and alloweth, that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes they came into the
Church to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they might profitably Exerciſe the gifts God gave;
and by the ſame (eſpecially by the gift of Propheſying) edifie one
another, and Teach one another. See this in Biſhop <hi>Jewels</hi> reply to
<hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing p.</hi> 192, 193. And the Biſhop himſelf agrees, that the
brethren as well as Officers may have gifts of the Spirit; theſe are his
words in <hi>p.</hi> 527. 532. That the Spirit of God is bound neither to
ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Wit, nor abundance of Learning; oft-times, (ſaith he,)
the unlearned ſeeth that thing that the learned cannot ſee,<note place="margin">See Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds in his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Hart. c. 2. p. 63</note> and
he there quotes <hi>Ephiphanus l.</hi> 2. for theſe words, only to the
Children of the Holy Ghoſt all the Scriptures are plain and clear.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in his

thoſe gifts are given to other Chriſtians as well as to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and that
they ought to uſe theſe tallents, as well as Officers; and there he proves
it by other places of Scripture alſo. So that it is plain, that the brethren
may have the Spirit of God and ſuch gifts of Propheſying as Officers have;
then ſurely it's given to them for uſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his Book before mentioned,
<hi>p.</hi> 249. ſaith, firſt that it was ſo in the Church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of
the Jews, theſe are his words; 
<q rend="margQuotes">that any one amongſt the Jews, who
enjoyed any repute for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or knowledge of the Law, was allowed a free
liberty of ſpeaking for the inſtruction of the People, as we ſee (ſaith

<bibl>
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15.</bibl>
               </q> though they were no
Officers. And ſecondly, he confeſſeth at large, that it was ſo in the

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:172259:20"/>The Truth is, there is not one preſident of
any credit for ſome hundred of years, of any complaint made againſt this
practice or uſe, as unlawful, irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or as an uſurpation of, or
intruſion upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters office, nor was there any decree in the
Church of God in thoſe dayes for the prohibiting of it. And it's very clear,
by all the places before, that every particular Congregation did order every
thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter themſelves and none elſe; ſince the Apoſtles
dayes, did intermedle with the ordering thereof.</p>
            <p>Now, how the prohibiting of the brethrens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their
Tallents in this caſe &amp; robbing of the Churches of that profit Chriſt
intended them, by beſtowing ſuch gifts, will be anſwered at the laſt
day can hardly be reſolved to the Comfort of ſuch who ſhall be active in
it.</p>
            <p>That theſe Churches or Congregations uſually met together for
the performance of theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, when, and where they
pleaſed,<note place="margin">Mr. Vines of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, p. 194. agrees that
theſe Churches have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo to do.</note> and as often as they agreed
ſo to do without any preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rules in the Apoſtles times, for either
time or place (except on the Lords day) and that theſe Churches practiſed
according to this liberty, for ſome ages: we think none can deny, ſince the
Scriptures every where clear it, where the meeting of Chriſtian Churches is
ſpoken of: ſometimes in Schools, ſometimes in Houſes, &amp;c. as the
Churches pleaſed, and was moſt convenient for them; and one Church was no
rule in this, to another; nor were any places or times ſet down, as Rules for
more than one Congregation to walk by; unleſſe, they did voluntarily
approve of what another did, and ſo do the ſame. Thus it was after the

conveniency of meeting, built ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, uſed others formerly built for
the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſome Perſons or things, as Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory teſtifies. And when the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops had prevailed with
the Emperor to ſhut up thoſe places from other Chriſtians; theſe met in
private places, and built them new ones, and there met by themſelves, yet
were not theſe blamed in thoſe days for theſe meetings, though not in
their publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; nor any puniſhment awarded for them: No, not by
theſe cruel <hi>Arian</hi> Emperors. In thoſe days nothing but the Churches

and to others it is given to know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in this ſence, the Scripture is not underſtood

It is not learning but the Spirit of God that makes men able to underſtand
Scriptures. Biſhop <hi>Jewel p.</hi> 216. he ſaith out of <hi>Tertul.
Contra Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> that knowledge of Philoſophy and affiance of
learning hath cauſed Diviſions and Hereſies in the Church, and therefore
he called the Philoſophers the Patriarchs of Hereticks; Again in <hi>p.</hi>
526, 527. out of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> he ſaith, that to underſtand Gods
Word, we need no ſilogiſmes or knowledge of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Husbandmen old men,
&amp;c. do underſtand it, that <hi>Julian</hi> charged the Chriſtians that
their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſo learned in the Scriptures, and again <hi>p.</hi> 532. he
ſaith, out of <hi>Epiphanius lib.</hi> 2. that only to the children of the
Holy Ghoſt all the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are plain and clear: and again
<hi>p.</hi> 434, that it is true that fleſh and blood is not able to
underſtand the will of God without ſpeciall revelation, Chriſt opened the
underſtanding of his Diſciples, that without this ſpeciall help of Gods
Spirit, the word of God is unto the reader (be he never ſo wiſe or learned,
ſaith he) as the Viſion of a Sealed Book, &amp;c. Secondly, as to this,
that the Spirit of God is not given to the Doctors, rulers of the Churches or
Learned men only; but alſo to all the members of Chriſt in common, in
ſome meaſure; and that they ought to ſearch the Scriptures, may
underſtand them by the help of this Spirit, as well as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who have
skill in tongues, and humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Cardinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> (though a

people to read the Scripture; That they are plain and eaſie; that the
Ignorant and Simple men, by prayer unto God may attain unto the knowledge of
them without any Maſter or Teacher, by himſelf alone;</hi> and he there

               <hi>there is no cauſe thou ſhouldeſt
deſire the teaching of thy fellow ſervant, for God himſelf will

cannot be that any man with great ſtudy, fervent deſire, reading the
Scripture, ſhould be deſtitute, though he want the teaching of man, yet
will God himſelf from above en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our hearts, and lighten our minds and

alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many Fathers to prove that the people ought to be diligent in
ſearching Scriptures both men and women; That that is the way to keep from
Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; That ſuch who ſearch cannot be deceived. And in <hi>p.</hi>
526. 527. he ſaith again, out of <hi>Gerſon.</hi> That the weighing and
conſideration of Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as well to others, as to the Prelates; yea
to the Lay People, and that better many times (ſaith he) then to many
Prieſts. And that we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe a Lay man, if he bring the
authority of Scripture then the Pope and a generall Councill. And again
<hi>p.</hi> 532. he (ſpeaking of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures)
ſaith, That in theſe things the Spirit of God is bound neither to
ſharpneſs of <pb n="56" facs="tcp:172259:30"/> Wit, nor to abundance of Learning;
oft-times the unlearned (ſaith he) ſeeth that thing that the learned cannot
ſee. And again after <hi>p.</hi> 534. having ſaid before, That without the
ſpeciall helps of Gods Spirit, the word of God is as a ſealed Book, &amp;c,
He there adds theſe words, That this revelation is not ſpeciall to ſome
but generall to all the members of Chriſt. And he here blames Mr.
<hi>Harding,</hi> for having ſo low an eſteem of the Vulgar people, as the
Scribes and Phariſees had of the followers of Chriſt: Theſe are
accurſed not knowing the law, ſaid they, Though the Apoſtles ſaith he,
calls them Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God. Again
<hi>p,</hi> 537. That the learned Fathers have evermore thought, that in ſuch
perillous times of diſſention in Judgment, it is moſt behoofull for the
people to have recourſe unto the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. And out of
<hi>Chryſoſtome: in opere imperfecto, Hom.</hi> 49. upon theſe words, ye
ſhall ſee the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, &amp;c. That Chriſtian men who will be
aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the true Faith muſt reſort to nothing but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures,
elſe (ſaith he) they will be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and periſh; and not knowing which
is the true Church, and by meanes thereof they ſhall fall into the
abomination of the deſolation. And out of <hi>Chryſoſt. Hom.</hi> 49.

as liked thoſe Rites, did commend them to their Poſterity for
Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his Book called the true way of
compoſing differences, pag. 26, 27. ſaith, <hi>That if a part of a
Church</hi> (ſpeaking there of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, as men tearm it)
<hi>ſhall give Law to the whole, ſuch part that ſo doth, for ſo doing
are Schiſmatick,</hi> If therefore any particular Church (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a part
of the whole in his ſence) ſhould make Rules for the whole, or if it be
ſaid that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation or Synod is ſuch a Church, who have this Power
to make Laws for the whole, theſe alſo are but a part of the Church in Mr.
<hi>Thorndikes</hi> ſence, and but a little part too. If theſe therefore
ſhall give Laws to the whole; then hear what <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi> ſaith. If
yet they ſay, <hi>This is the whole Church in their Repreſentative.</hi>
Anſwer firſt, cannot juſtly call themſelves the Repreſentative of the
whole; for they were neither choſen nor ſent by the whole, nor did the
whole ever intruſt them with any ſuch Power: Nor were they choſen, ſent
and intruſted by the particular Churches of the whole, without which (in any
rational way) they cannot be ſuppoſed to be the whole Church, in her
Repreſentative: no, nor the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her
Repreſentative, if not ſo ſent, choſen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by the
particular Churches thereof as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; nor will they (we preſume) challenge
any authority from Chriſt, immediately derived upon their perſons to be the
Churches Repreſentative, and to make Laws for them.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, If it ſhould be granted (though againſt all
reaſon) that they do indeed repreſent the Church of <hi>England:</hi> yet
then it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Word of God, or very good authority, 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:172259:35"/> that any ſuch Repreſentative was called the Church and
ſo accounted, and hath ſuch power to make Laws for many Churches or
Congregations by Divine-right, and to whoſe Laws thoſe Churches were bound
to give obedience for Conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>If that in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. be urged, it ſeems to be
alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent, unleſſe they will make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (and
whether all or ſome only we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine) <hi>the Elders of the Church
in</hi> Jeruſalem, and all the brethren of that Church, a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or
Synod. And ſuch another we can hardly find now adayes; that this was ſo and
no other, is apparent from the very Text, for all theſe met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about
the matter, and it is ſaid verſe 22. <hi>It pleaſed the Apoſtles and
Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men of their own
Company,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cheif men amongſt the brethren;</hi> and in the
next verſes we find, That the Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren, wrote about
the matter, and ſay, <hi>It ſeems good to us being aſſembled together,
with one accord to ſend,</hi> &amp;c. here the brethren were as much the
Convocation, as the Elders. But then alſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cauſes, why the
Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent to this Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about
this matter, and why they in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> write their mind again to
them, they are two. The firſt may be Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that is, becauſe there
were ſome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the ſecond is Expreſſed, that is,
becauſe thoſe men who came to <hi>Antioch</hi> and preached the
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion there, pretended that they came from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
from the Apoſtles and whole Church there, with this Doctrine: therefore was
there great reaſon, why they ſhould apply themſelves to them to be
reſolved of the truth in that matter, for about the ſame queſtion
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="68" facs="tcp:172259:36"/> diſputed
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and alſo mark the matter they write about, it hath a
ſuitableneſs to that, which they had deſired to be reſolved in. The
epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells them, that they who wrote the Epiſtle, had given no ſuch
commands to thoſe men to teach ſuch things, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. And further,
<hi>That it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt to lay no greater burthen upon
them than ſuch neceſſary things therein mentioned,</hi> which things were
neceſſary to be abſtained from; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the uſe of them would then
have offended, and fornication was ſin in it ſelf; and by the way, note,
here are no new things required to be done of thoſe, but ſomewhat they
ſhould forbear to do, becauſe by doing it they may offend ſuch who could
not judge it to be lawfully done, and ſin. Here now is not the leaſt
footſteps for ſuch a Synod as the Convocation, our Council of Biſhops or
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as a Church to make lawes which ſhall be binding to any more
than themſelves, who agree to them. For the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
(had ſuch a thing fallen out with them as did at <hi>Antioch;</hi> That
ſome had come from <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and that Church, with
falſe Doctrine unto them) might as well have written to them at
<hi>Antioch,</hi> to have been reſolved, And <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> and the Elders and Brethren of that Church of
<hi>Antioch</hi> might have written an Anſwer to them with equall
authority.</p>
            <p>Nay, but is there ground to give like credit or ſubjection to a
Rule of any Convocation or Synod now, as there was to the Apoſtles in thoſe
days? Surely No; But if it be ſaid, that they are the Churches
Repreſentative, and their Lawes are the Lawes of the Church by humane
authority only, then it will be neceſſary to prove, That ſuch, who 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:172259:36"/> take upon them to make Churches and Convey po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to them,
by their Lawes, have ſuch a power delegated to them from Jeſus Chriſt
ſo to do; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their Lawes will not creat ſuch a Church with
authority in theſe caſes, and to whoſe Laws o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is to be expected
for Conſcience ſake. The old Rule muſt be remembered, None can give to
another that he hath not in himſelf.</p>
            <p>But if it be ſaid, that the Governours of the Churches of a
Nation or Kingdome, with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates authority, have power to determine
of matters indifferent in their owne nature, about the worſhip of God and in
Church Government, and by Law to impoſe them, upon the particular Churches of
that Nation.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this firſt, we think it a matter of no ſmall
difficulty, for either Magiſtrates or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Churches, or both
together to determine what things are ſo indifferent in their own Nature,
about the worſhip of God, and as to their uſe and practice, that they
muſt needs be ſo accounted by all the members of the Churches there:<note place="margin">Hookers Eccleſ Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Preface.</note> For this is
Neceſſary in this Caſe: Chriſts Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear in
this; That if any abſolutely indifferent thing uſed or impoſed be really
an offence to weak Chriſtians, that is, when ſuch weak ones do upon
ſerious thoughts, judge the things themſelves in their own nature, not
indifferent, or elſe as they are uſed and circumſtantiated, but ſinfull
or ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in this caſe they may not be uſed by other
Chriſtians, much leſſe impoſed: For if theſe weak ones ſhould do
this, when impoſed, while they thus judge, they ſhould ſin, And for
ſuch as look upon theſe things and impoſe them as indifferent, they may
without the leaſt ſcruple lay aſide the uſe <pb n="70" facs="tcp:172259:37"/> of
them themſelves, and much more diſpenſe with others for not uſing them:
For a thing purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different may as well not be uſed as uſed,
eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they prove an offence to others; If men chooſe to obey God
rather than Men.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaith Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum.
p.</hi> 63. <hi>That nothing ſhould be determined, but what is ſufficiently
known to be indifferent in its own nature, and he there confeſſeth, that
there is a great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to know ſufficiently what is ſo;</hi> and
gives this as his reaſon, <hi>becauſe one looks upon that to be
indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent which another doth not.</hi> And again in <hi>p.</hi> 118.
119.<note place="margin">See Doctor More in Book call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of

Conſcence.</note> He ſaith, <hi>that the power of Governours in theſe
things extends not to bind men to go againſt the dictates of their own
Reaſon and Conſciences,</hi> and again there, ſaith he, <hi>when all is
ſaid every man will be his own judge in this caſe concerning his own
welfare, and that an erroneous Conſcience takes not off the obligation to

in the caſe, but that men do differently judge of the ſame things, both as
they are in their own nature, and alſo in their uſe and ends) Church
Governours would find it work enough to determine ſuch things ſo as it

about Gods worſhip unlawful as to their uſe; that is, where they are uſed
by the generality of people, not as indifferent things but as neceſſary;
with an opinion that their worſhip is not perfect except it be performed
after the manner determined, which is an abuſe of them. It is true the
Papiſts ſay of their Images, they are but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things: yet it is
well known, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them do not ſo eſteem of them; which
Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> alſo fully agrees, in the ſame Book <hi>p.</hi>
64. So it is certainly known amongſt us Proteſtants, that the generality do
look upon and eſteem of many things (indifferent in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
determined and long in uſe, as neceſſary; ſo that they think no part of
Gods Worſhip, or Church affairs well performed, or perfect, if not exactly
done, according to that rule determined and in uſe; and therefore will not
willingly do any thing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; though they were never Compelled to it by
law: which indeed hath been the ordinary effect of a Conſtant uſe of any
indifferent thing about wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Church matters, that people by Cuſtome
and Uſage drink down an opinion of the neceſſity of their uſe, and
cannot endure their removal: Wherefore that indifferent things might be ſtill
known to be ſo, and ſo accounted: they ſhould be uſed indifferently;
and not the ſame conſtantly, to prevent this ſuperſtitious and

            <p>Thirdly. This alſo may make the uſe of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things

uſed; then much leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Proteſtants in generall agree; That
it is ſufficient warrant for our ſeparation from the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they impoſe things upon mens Conſciences as
neceſſary, which are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, unlawfull, ſuſpected, or offenſive
to weak brethren. This Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> agrees in his ſaid Book;

theſe things ſee what the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Divines ſay. <hi>That in the

            <p>But if it be ſaid here, That theſe things are not determined,
as things neceſſary, but as things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: For Anſwer, Firſt,
Neither thoſe who determine theſe things, nor thoſe who do impoſe them
do declare, that ſuch things ſo determined in the whole of them, are
indifferent things in their own Nature, nor that they ought to be ſo
accounted in the uſe of them. And Secondly, It ſeems clear, that they do
determine of theſe things above others, and ſo uſe themſelves, not as
things indifferent, but as things neceſſary, and ſo immediately binding
to Mens Conſciences: For either they determine of them, above others, and
ſo impoſe them, as things tending to Peace and Edification, and for Decency
and Order; or for no end at all (unleſs it be to make Men bow to the Judgment
of ſuch Men who thus determine;) if the latter, no warrant can be pretended
for it; if the former, then are the things neceſſary (if we muſt look on
them to tend to this end more than other indifferent things do) for things,
truly tending to thoſe ends, we are bound to regard by Divine Command, and
ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience becomes bound. Whatſoever things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their

in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt them with this Power; but the Truth lyeth in the quite contrary:
For, Firſt, Thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to determine thus for the Churches, will
not confeſs, That theſe Churches have Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of themſelves,
or to chooſe any to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for them; and then they can never prove any
ſuch Power by the Churches Vote. No ſuch things were known among the
Primitive Goſpel-Churches; For every Church or Congregation did in theſe
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things even as they amongſt themſelves judged fit, and agreed,
being left free by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſo the Churches uſed them.
None for many Ages undertook to determine, nor did the Churches impower any
ſo to do. Nor indeed is any ſuch truſt repoſed in any Perſons, by the
Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at this day. The particular Bodies of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and many of
their Officers too, are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in this Matter, as inſignificant
Cyphers. It is true, Epiſcopal Aſſemblies, after a few Ages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to
take upon them to give ſome Rules to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (though thoſe were
Obſerved, but ſo far as the Churches thought good) yet theſe
determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theirs, anſwered not the ends pretended: 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172259:41"/> For, as it is cited before in this Diſcourſe, out of
<hi>Gregory. That Contentions have been always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by Epiſcopal
Aſſemblies; ſo, he that reads the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory
impartially, may every where plainly perceive the truth thereof: And how far
they anſwered the ends of Order, Edification, Peace, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the
Churches in theſe days, we ſhall leave the judicious obſervers of ſuch
things to judge.</hi> Then may we enquire further, <hi>How any rational Account
can be given, why one part of the Chriſtians in a Nation, and thoſe very
few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the whole, ſhould determine of ſuch things to be
impoſed, for all the reſt, ſeeing no ſpecial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is derived upon
them ſo to do, nor any promiſe of infallible Guidance in this matter
entailed upon Them more than upon others.</hi> And as to theſe Matters we
ſhall offer a few things more, in Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> his own words,
in the ſame <hi>Irenicum,</hi> p. 45, 46. <hi>That the Paſtors or Governors
of Churches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> Mat. 28.20. <hi>To teach what Chriſt had
commanded them; but no Authority,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by given to make
new Laws to bind the Church, but rather a tying them up to the Commandments of
Chriſt, already laid down in his Word.</hi> For, ſaith he, <hi>A Power to
bind Mens Conſciences to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations lodged in the Officers of the
Church, muſt be derived either from the Law of God giving them this right, or
elſe only from the conſent of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: For any Law of God, there is none
produced,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with any probability of Reaſon, but that,</hi>
Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey thoſe who have the Rule,</hi> &amp;c. But that, ſaith
he, <hi>implies no more than ſubmitting to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of
the Goſpel, and to thoſe whom Chriſt hath Conſtituted as Paſtors of
his Church, wherein the Law of Chriſt doth require <pb n="80" facs="tcp:172259:42"/>
obedience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>gives them no
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make new Laws or Conſtitutions binding mens Conſcience, any
more than a command from a Superiour Authority, that inferior Magiſtrates
ſhould be obeyed doth imply a Power in them to make new Laws to bind
them.</hi> Yet he here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth a Power ariſing from the free conſent
of the parties ſubmitting: <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is moſt
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Nature of Church Power, being not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active but directive. And
that ſuch was the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Diſcipline of the Primitive times;</hi> And
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain further in p. 118, 119. That if it be ſaid, <hi>that men are bound to
be ruled by their Governours in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what things are lawful and what
not,</hi> he Anſwers, <hi>That no true Proteſtants can ſwear blind
obedience to Church Governours in all things;</hi> That it is the Higheſt
uſurpation, to rob men of the Liberty of their Judgment: That it is our plea
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts, that every one hath a Judgment of private
diſcretion, which is the rule of practice, as to himſelf.</p>
            <p>We (ſaith he) <hi>allow a Ministerial Power in the
Governours:</hi> yet (he ſaith) <hi>this extends not to bind men to go
againſt the dictates of their own reaſon and Conſcience,</hi> their Power
is only directive and declarative, and in matters of Duty can bind no more than
reaſon and evidence brought from Scripture by them, doth. Again either
therefore men are bound to obey all things abſolutely, and without any
reſtriction or limitation; which (ſaith he) if it be not Uſurpation and
Dominion over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Faith in them, and the worſt of implicit Faith in
others; It is hard to define what either of them is: or elſe if they are
bound to obey only in lawful things, <hi>I then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>enquire,
who muſt <pb n="81" facs="tcp:172259:42"/> be judge what things are Lawful and what
not:</hi> If the Governors, ſtill then the Power will be abſolute again,
for to be ſure (ſaith he) what ever they Command they will ſay, it is
Lawful either in it ſelf, or as they Command it. If every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
muſt be judge, what is lawful and what not, which is Commanded, then he is
bound no further to obey than he judgeth the thing to be lawful, which is
commanded. And he there affirms,<note place="margin">See the Biſhop of Glou.
Apol. p. 41.</note> (as we have before ſet down) that every man will be his
own judge in this Caſe; and that the plea of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conſcience takes
not off the Obligation to follow the dictates of it. Again let men (ſaith he)
turn and wind themſelves which way they will, by the ſame Arguments any
will prove ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Lawful; becauſe
ſhe requires unlawful things as Conditions of her Communion. It will be
proved Lawful not to conform to any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or unlawful practiſe
required by any Church Governours upon the ſame Terms, if the things ſo
required, be upon ſerious and ſober enquiry judged unwarrantable by a mans
own Conſcience. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in p. 120. 121. he quotes Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of
Schiſm, p. 8. for this, That where any thing unneceſſary, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and by many held unlawful, is impoſed; it is duty to ſeparate. See this
more at large tranſcribed there in Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who there
Commends <hi>Hales</hi> for as Learned and Judicious a Divine, as this Nation
bred. And Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> there adds theſe words. <hi>If we</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>would take away all unneceſſary things, ſuſpected by
many, and judged unlawful by ſome, and make nothing the bounds of our
Communion but what Chriſt hath done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>allowing a liberty for
matters of indifferency, and bearing with the weakneſs of thoſe, who cannot
bear <pb n="82" facs="tcp:172259:43"/> things which others account lawful; We might,</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>indeed be reſtored to a true Primitive luſtre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which things of Mr. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> may as forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be turned againſt the Magiſtrates impoſing theſe things by Law, as
againſt the Church Governors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining them to be impoſed: for if one
were not abſolute in their Power, to determine of one indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing
above another, for others to practiſe; ſure neither the other to impoſe
ſuch things:<note place="margin">Tertul fo Scapula.</note> for what ever may
not lawfully be determined for, or required of, may not be impoſed upon
others, and they compelled to obedience. That which Chriſt hath left
indifferent about theſe things ſhould be ſo uſed, and no man ſhould
preſume to take away their indifferency by impoſing them by force of Law;

above another, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſteemeth every day alike. And again, I know that
nothing is unclean of it ſelf, but to him that eſteemeth any thing unclean,
to him it is unclean. All things are pure, but it is evil for that man who
eateth with offence; therefore he directs here, that every manſhould be fully
perſwaded in his own mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.14.20. and chap. 15.1. That the
ſtrong ſhould bear with the infirmities of the weak. And again 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4.7. he ſaith, we know an Idol is nothing, &amp;c. howbeit
there is not in every man this knowledge: where he alſo in the latter end of
the ſame chapter, exhorteth thoſe who do know, to have reſpect to thoſe
who do not know, and rather than offend them, not to uſe their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in ſuch things which were indifferent in their own Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:172259:43"/>Thus we ſee the Apoſtle (though he could
infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly reſolve the lawfulneſs of the things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) yet
would he be ſo far from determining theſe things to be done by others who
had other apprehenſions, that he would not uſe the things
themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor would he have others to uſe them, where their uſe
proved offenſive to weak ones: and would have every one perſwaded in his
own mind (and this he knew was Gods prerogative only) Such who offend their
brethren by the contrary, ſin againſt Chriſt. How then is it poſſible
to juſtifie an impoſition of ſuch things by Laws (which ſay they, bind
Conſcience to obedience becauſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate commands) upon ſuch who

they do it not, they ſin in not obeying the Magiſtrate (if the Magiſtrate
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands makes it neceſſary;) ſure we are, that in the Primitive
Churches, they thought ſo: for neither Governours of Churches, nor Emperours
(when Chriſtian) did for ſome ages, determine for, or impoſe upon many
Churches in theſe things; or if any did tamper this way, the Churches did not
take themſelves at all bound to regard it: for in thoſe dayes ſo may
Churches or Congregations, ſo many ſeveral uſages or forms in theſe
things, as each Church thought beſt and moſt convenient for them. Thus the
<hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Divines agree <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.
<hi>Col.</hi> 134.135. That every Church had a like Power to exerciſe the
Ceremonies received from the Apoſtles, or to make new ones for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
ſo alſo ſaith <hi>Socrates</hi> of his dayes in his 5th. Book 21. chap.
<hi>Engliſh tranſl.</hi> p. 351. &amp;c. That <pb n="84" facs="tcp:172259:44"/> in
thoſe days there were diverſity of obſervations and Rites in ſeveral
Churches, without any forcing of any, but every Church as it ſeemed good to
them, &amp;c. That it is plain, that the Apoſtles left every man free without
Fear, Compulſion, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, to adict himſelf to that which
ſeemeth to him to be good and Commendable; That hardly could two Churches be
found, that obſerved the ſame Rites, and Ceremonies; that in the
obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and other holy dayes every man did as he
thought good, &amp;c. ſee this at large.</p>
            <p>So that from all that hath been ſaid in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; we cannot
think that upon a ſober diſcourſe, Thoſe that call themſelves the
Governours of the Church will ever arrogate to themſelves, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretence of
Divine Authority, any ſpecial right to determine of any indifferent thing
above another, to be that which is every way lawful and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and
that which is moſt for edification, decency and order, unity and peace in the
Church: Or that they have any ſpecial skill of judging in this caſe, above
other learned and Godly men in the Church: and if not, then it may be believed
that they will ſay, be it far from us to determine in ſuch caſes, for
others, or to deſire our determinations ſhould be impoſed upon others;
And then we are confident the Magiſtrate will be farther from Challenging any
right to determine of thoſe things, nor will he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to impoſe by Law
upon the Churches: but it hath been common amongſt Church men to deal
ſubtilly in theſe things, firſt themſelves deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and ſet down
Rules in theſe caſes, and tender them to the Magiſtrate to confirm by
Laws, as thoſe things which are neceſſary to the ends aforeſaid; And
then when they are eſtabliſhed by Law; and <pb n="85" facs="tcp:172259:44"/> they
themſelves cannot juſtifie many or any of them to be neceſſary, or any
way anſwering the ends propoſed; They preſently lay the charge upon the
Magiſtrates, and ſay, its commanded and we muſt obey, being by virtue of
his Law bound in Conſcience ſo to do. Certainly, let us not deceive our
ſelves, God is not mocked, Chriſt hath pronounced a wo againſt them by
whom offences come. The excuſe of the Magiſtrates commanding it, will not
ſerve their turn when our Lord comes to judge in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Yet there are ſome who are highly offended againſt ſuch who
walk after the Rules herein before ſet down, as near as they can, and fear to
erre from it, as that way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and managing of Church affairs, which
they judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word to be Chriſt's mind they ſhould walk by;
and as that in which the Churches, in the Primitive and beſt ages walked; and
which alſo hath been by many learned and Godly men in all ages ſince, held
to be the true way. And theſe offended ones generally conclude againſt
ſuch, that they are Separatiſts from the Church, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Factious,
&amp;c. for ſo doing (the old Callumnies caſt upon the Apoſtles and other
Saints in former ages, and by Papiſts upon Proteſtants in latter ages) and
their way called Hereſie and evil ſpoken of, as <hi>Act.</hi> 24
<hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 28. Though in Truth theſe offended ones
underſtand not, in this caſe, what they ſay, or whereof they affirm:
either it is pure ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in ſuch, not underſtanding what a Church is,
from which properly a Separation may be ſaid to be made, or in which a man
may be ſaid to be guilty of making a Schiſme; or what Act it is that may
properly be called a ſeparation from, or conſtitute a man a Schiſmatick
in ſuch a Church; or elſe ignorance, that is wilful, ariſing from
intereſt that blinds them: Theſe do juſt (as the Presbyterian
Miniſters, once ſaid in <hi>Smect.</hi> p. 58. 59. take it in their own
words. <hi>Theſe do (as the Papiſts) dazle the Eyes and aſtoniſh the
ſenſes of poor People with the Glorious name of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:172259:45"/> This is the <hi>Gorgons-Head</hi> (as Doctor
<hi>White</hi> ſaid) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted them: they call, ſay they for
obedience to the Church, &amp;c. no mention of God and Scripture, If we (ſay
theſe Divines there) queſtion what is meant by the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> they ſtorm, as he that holdeth by an unjuſt Tytle will
not ſuffer the Tytle to be queſtioned; they (ſay theſe men) ſometimes
make the Convocation the Church, excluding both Presbiters and people, as not
worthy to be reckoned of the Church; ſometimes the bounds of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is
the Church. If ſo, ſay they, why not <hi>England, Scotl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> one Church, being under one Monarch.</p>
            <p>Thus they contend and know not upon what foundation; but, having
heard of the name of the Church, and found Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Formes of worſhip
amongſt them, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline uſed according to humane Laws and
Conſtitutions: here they go and never ſo much as enquire, or put it to the
queſtion, whether they are agreeable to Scripture, or Rules preſcribed by
God; And then they take it for granted preſently; that ſuch, who do not in
theſe matters as they do, are Separatiſts and Schiſmaticks, and deſerve
puniſhment (as raſhly as the two Diſciples did in another caſe
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. who would have fire from heaven upon the <hi>Samaritanes:</hi>
but they knew not what Spirit they were of, as Chriſt told them; they never
conſidered upon what ground they deſired ſuch a thing, whether it were
Chriſt mind or not, that it ſhould be ſo. And as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
quoted by Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his aforeſaid Book, p. 61.62.
complained of men in his dayes about Ceremonies, who contended highly, yet had
no ground for it but this, (as his words are) <hi>becauſe it had been the
cuſtom of their Country, or becauſe they have found them in another
Church,</hi> &amp;c. they think that nothing is right and Lawful, but what they
do themſelves. And as Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his Reply before cited,
ſaid of many Hereticks, That they had nothing to plead, but that they were
born, lived in, and received of their Fathers what they did practiſe: 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:172259:45"/> upon ſome ſuch poor grounds as theſe doth the
ignorance of men work, thus to abuſe their brethren. And that it may ſo
appear. Let ſuch perſons be perſwaded to weigh the premiſes well in the
fear of God, and take theſe concluſions with him. Firſt, that ſuch who
continue in the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (and thus hold Union with
the Head of the Church according to <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5.) continue in and do
not ſeparate from the Catholick Church the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
the firſt Church in this diſcourſe deſcribed; for there is no other
Union between the members of this Church (as ſuch) but this, their being by
one Faith united to one Head; and from thence animated by one Spirit; and
ſuch who ſo continue, cannot be called Schiſmaticks in this Church. To
this Doctor <hi>Carleton</hi> agrees in his aforeſaid Book <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7,
8 9, 10. &amp;c. 2dly. That ſuch who continue to make a profeſſion of the
Faith of our Lord Jeſus, and do not openly deny him in their works, do
ſtill abide in the viſible body of Jeſus Chriſt, The Church 2dly above
deſcribed, and cannot be ſaid to ſeparate from this Church, or be guilty
of Schiſme here; for this profeſſion is the only thing wherein the unity
of the whole viſible Church lyeth. And thus Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> in
his Book called a <hi>Rational Account</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 331. ſaith,
<hi>That there is no ſeparation from the whole Church, but in ſuch things
wherein the unity of the whole lyeth: For ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is
a violation of ſome union.</hi> 3dly. That ſuch who continue to walk in,
and with any viſible Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Congregation or particular Church on earth,
holding the true faith, in the orderly participation of Ordinances in man-as
the Scripture directs, and in ſubjection to Chriſts Lawes given to be
executed therein, as ſuch a Church, the Church 3dly above deſcribed; he
cannot be ſaid to ſeparate from, or be guilty of ſchiſme in this
Church.</p>
            <p>Now then if theſe offended ones will juſtifie their charge
againſt ſuch who do not in Church affaires, as they do; It is neceſſary
they prove ſuch whom they thus accuſe, guilty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="88" facs="tcp:172259:46"/>
of infidelity abſolute, or of their denying their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Jeſus
Chriſt, or of withdrawing from the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Society to which they
were regularly joyned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt cauſe, &amp; refuſing to walk in
ſuch a Church of Chriſt in the orderly participation of ordinances and to
ſubmit to the laws of Chriſt exerciſed therein. Or they muſt find a
fourth Church deſcribed in Scripture, or in the Apoſtles dayes; and ſhew
ſuch a one now, from which a man may be ſaid in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſence to
ſeparate; &amp; alſo prove what act it is, that makes a ſeparation from
that Church; And that theſe perſons are guilty of ſeparation thence by
ſuch an Act, or elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally conclude any of theſe to be
ſeparatiſts, or ſciſmaticks, in any ſence at all: If they can do
neither of theſe, they will ſee cauſe to be angry no longer.</p>
            <p>But it is poſſible they may alledge againſt ſome of
theſe, that they have ſeparated from the particular Congregations whereto
ſometimes they were joyned; therefore are they ſeperatiſts: For Anſw.
firſt, Then it muſt be proved, that they were regularly joyned to that
Congregation; that is, by a voluntary Act of theirs in underſtanding which is
prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome expreſſe deſire, in him that joynes; and an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
admiſſion by the Society to which he is joyned: For a man may ignorantly
ſit down at a Sacrament in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where no order is obſerved,
to prevent that confuſion, as in Moſt Pariſh Churches; yet this makes not
a regular joyning, nor him a fixed member of that Church or Society; a heathen
may do this; beſides, this is not conſiſting with the nature of a regular
Society of rationall men, much leſs of Chriſtians, where muſt be a
conſideration or compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the parties obliged; yea further, if a
man be made of ſuch a pariſh by the law of the land, and bound by the Law,
joyn with the ſame Pariſh as a Church, and be one of the members thereof;
This cannot be a regular joyning him to this Church neither, without his own
voluntary Act: For by the Law of Nature, and the law of God, men are left free
to <pb n="89" facs="tcp:172259:46"/> joyn themſelves to what Congregation or Society they
pleaſed;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos 3.3</hi> How can two walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

the very nature and well being of ſuch Societies, to force men to be of this
or that Society againſt their own minds, and without the free conſent of
the Society it ſelf: yet this was the caſe of moſt (we preſume) who
withdrew from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches and Societies; either they did never by any
act deſire a regular admittance, or did the Society ever in truth make any
Actuall admiſſion; only ſate down at a Sacrament, or they were made of
the Society by a Law, neither of which can be made out to be ſuch a regular
joyning to that Society, as to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that Church, yet if they remove to another Church (if the Church of
<hi>England</hi> be but true to their own Principles, and own their common
practices,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>p.

lye in this neither: for they allow a man to leave one pariſh and go to
another, for conveniency of Habitation, Ayre, Trade, &amp;c. Bodily advantages,
and then joyn with the other Pariſh Church, as a member there, and leave the
firſt: yea and that without acquainting the firſt Church, (whereof he was a
Member) with his intentions, and for this he ſhall be no Separatiſt: ſo
that from this it's clear, that ſeparation lyes not barely in this; that men
leave one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or Society and joyn themſelves to another. And wee
think it may eaſily be granted, that if outward concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be enough to
acquit a man from the guilt of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on ſuch an account, and warrant
his remove from one Church to another; much more may Soul concernment,
ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a leaving of one Church and adjoyning to another. Yet 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:172259:47"/> further we hope none will deny, but that there may be
juſt cauſe for withdrawing from ſome Societies; and whether this might
not fall in for a ſufficient plea for many to clear themſelves by, from any
crime upon the account of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the Society where once they were,
and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another: Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his ſaid
<hi>Irenicum,</hi> p. 117. 118. 120. agrees thus much; <hi>That where any
Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining purity of doctrine, do require the owning of, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to, any unlawful or ſuſpected practice, men may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deny
conformity to and communion with that Church in ſuch things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hales of Schiſme <hi>p. 8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the guilt of Sciſme,</hi> and gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; <hi>If our
ſeparation from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>was therefore lawfull becauſe
ſhe required unlawfull things, as Conditions of her Communion. Then wherever
ſuch things are required by any Church, Non-communion with that Church in
thoſe things will be lawfull too; And where</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>Non-communion is lawfull, there can be no Schiſme in it. If that
juſtified our withdrawing from the Church of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">Mr.
<hi>Raynolds</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Hart</hi> p. 666. 667.</note> 
               <hi>will
it not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mens Non-conformity in things
ſuppoſed by them to be unlawfull.</hi> And again, <hi>our beſt Writers
againſt the Papiſts lay the imputation of Schiſme not upon theſe who
withdraw Communion, but upon thoſe who require ſuch things, whereby they
did rather eject men out of their Communion, than the others ſeparate from
them:</hi> And he quotes Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of Schiſme, to prove fully, The
refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Communion (in caſe any unneceſſary things, ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome, and held unlawfull by others, be made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Communion) to
be Lawfull, and Duty, &amp;c. Now it may be this might be the caſe of every
one who hath withdrawn Communion from pariſhes; that many things are required
there, whithout a Conformity to which, no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can be had with them; That
theſe required things are, (in the judgment of thoſe who thus withdraw)
unneceſſary <pb n="91" facs="tcp:172259:47"/> uſeleſs, unlawfull or ſuſpected at
leaſt: And then this will, upon the ſame grounds, acquit every ſuch one
(who have withdrawn) from the Charge of Sciſme. And though Mr.
<hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> ſeems a little (in the 117. <hi>p.</hi> of the ſaid
Book) to mince it in theſe words. <hi>I ſay not that men may proceed to
erecting of new Churches.</hi> Yet he in his Book called a Rational Account
&amp;c. <hi>p</hi> 332. ſeems to own ſuch a thing, when he pleads againſt
<hi>Rome,</hi> and juſtifies Proteſtants ſeparations Theſe are his
words; <hi>Suppoſe all the particular men I converſe with were Leprous, my
aſſociating my ſelf with them, doth not imply any ſeparation from the
Communion of all mankind, but that I am loth to be infected as they are;
Therefore I withdraw till I can meet with healthfull perſons, withwhom I can
aſſociate again; And if ſeveral other perſons</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be
of the ſame mindwith me, and we therefore joyn together, do we therefore
divide our ſelves from the whole world?</hi> Thus he in this place clearly
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated a withdrawing from one Society upon good grounds; and then for as
many as be ſo withdrawn, and of the ſame mind, to joyn themſelves
together and aſſociate by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that is no ſeparation. And no
doubt, but that there is matter enough to be found, ſufficiently to warrant
ſuch perſons in this alſo as well as in withdrawing Communion.</p>
            <p>But if yet they ſhall ſay the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
that from which theſe ſeparate. How, pray? If the Church of
<hi>England</hi> be granted to be a Church in either, or both of the two
firſt Deſcriptions herein before given (though, in Truth ſhe be but a
little part of both) yet there is no other Union with her as one Church, nor
can there be; but the Union in Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th under one Head, Jeſus Chriſt, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the
ſame Spirit, and the profeſſion of this Faith: So that none can be ſaid
to ſeparate from her as a Church, or be guilty of Schiſm or breach of Union
here, but ſuch who renounce the Faith and their Union with Chriſt the Head
in Word or Deed, and forſake their profeſſion of it. And this Church of
<hi>England</hi> cannot be pretended to be a <pb n="92" facs="tcp:172259:48"/> particular
Church under the third Deſcription; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet aſſociated as
ſuch; nor is it poſſible for them as a Church to meet in one intire body
in one place to partake of the ſame Ordinances, or do any other Act, as a
Church or Society, but always met in their ſeveral Bodies or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for
performing of all Acts of a Church as ſuch. In like manner alſo, do theſe
who are ſo blamed. Therefore in this ſence neither, can they be (by any
Rule of Reaſon) ſaid to be guilty of Schiſm.</p>
            <p>If theſe Offended ones ſhall yet ſay thus. That ſuch Men
refuſe to joyn with our Congregations and Miniſters in our way: For
Anſwer to this (beſides what hath been ſaid before to juſtifie their
continuing by themſelves;) Firſt, it's thought in Charity to be preſumed,
That theſe Men are convinced of the Truth of the premiſes; That in truth,
all things about Church-Affairs were managed in and by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches,
Congregations, or Societies by Divine Authority, and ſo Ordered as before:
Their Miniſters cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the Matter of their Worſhip without any
addition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, or diminiſhing according to Divine Rules; Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Perſons caſt out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That theſe cannot judge it Lawful for
them to do any thing in theſe matters, contrary, or not according to this
Rule; but think, if they ſhould, they muſt ſin againſt God. And then
this muſt needs be a ſufficient plea for theſe, in this caſe;
eſpecially ſince other things (to them doubtful, unneceſſary, and
ſinful) are made neceſſary Conditions of Communion with thoſe
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: So that none can communicate with them, but of neceſſity he
muſt ſubmit to, own, and joyn with there things, and neglect the other way.
Secondly, Is any man bound to joyn with, or partake in every Congregation in
<hi>England,</hi> or in more than one? or muſt he be guilty of the breach of
Union? Surely no; may not a Man abide in his own Pariſh all his Life, and
refuſe to have any Miniſter but his own, or Communicate with any
Congregation, but that <pb n="93" facs="tcp:172259:48"/> whereof he is a Member? Yet he
ſhall not for this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Schiſmatick, or Separatiſt: It is
preſumed, no Man will ſay, he ſhall. Wherein then lyes the difference?
Theſe men thus accuſed do joyn themſelves to ſome one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or
Church of God, according to the Rules, as was in the beginning, and there they
abide in the Orderly parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Ordinances and Subjection to Chriſts
Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in executed, and diſagree in nothing of the true Faith from other
Churches. So that it follows, That barely upon this pretence neither, can they
faſten the Crime of Separation upon thoſe, who do not joyn with their
Congregations and Miniſters. May not members of Pariſh-Churches be as
properly ſaid to be Separatiſts for refuſing to joyn themſelves to
thoſe Congregations, Societies, or Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in their
Worſhipping of God, as theſe for not joyning with them? Nor can it be
ſaid, That theſe diſ-agree with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in any
thing wherein the whole Church of God is agreed, or the whole Church of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but only in ſome things wherein the Church of God, yea, in
<hi>England,</hi> diſ-agree amongſt themſelves; as Mr.
<hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his ſaid Book, called, <hi>A Rational
Account,</hi> p. 357, 358. affirms againſt the Papiſts, in theſe words:
<hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have not ſeparated from the whole Chriſtian
World, in any thing wherein the whole Chriſtian World is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed: But to
diſ-agree from the particular Churches of the Chriſtian World in thoſe
things wherein thoſe Churches differ amongſt themſelves, is not to
ſeparate from the Chriſtian World, but to diſ-agree in ſome things from
theſe particular Churches.</hi> The caſe is here the ſame: Theſe do not
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> but only diſ-agree in
thoſe things wherein the particular Churches differ amongſt themſelves.
And then walk with ſuch who can and will agree with them in theſe things.
If they ſay the Pariſh-Churches are moſt Lawful and right, and ſo their
Miniſters, Miniſtration, and Order. Let this be firſt decided by Gods 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:172259:49"/> Word, and their Lawfulneſs better proved, than the
Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Miniſtry and Order, and Management of Church-Affairs, amongſt
theſe; and before ſet forth as the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Practice; and then they ſay
ſomething.</p>
            <p>But if they juſtifie all by the Law of the Land only, it may
ſoon be anſwered by this, That it was not ſo from the beginning. That the
other way is proved by the Law of God, and Practice of the Primitive Churches,
and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Learned and good Men in all Ages; yea, and of Men of
contrary Practices themſelves: Therefore ſurely the beſt plea againſt
this. For if Magiſtrates or Governors appoint any thing in theſe matters
not agreeable to theſe Rules, ſo that Men cannot be ſatisfied in their
own minds, but doubt it's Lawfulneſs; ſuch doubting ones may not be in the
practice of it, (till they be ſatisfied of it's Lawfulneſs) without ſin:
Nor will it be a ſufficient Excuſe in the great Day of the Lord, if they
thus ſin, To ſay, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate commanded me to do it.</p>
            <p>If they ſhall yet further alledge, That theſe Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
not to, Walk not in thoſe Practices and Rules in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> which are preſcribed by the ſame Church, and to which the
generality of the ſame Church agree, and ſubmit; and therefore they may be
ſaid to be Separatiſts and Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>Though a full Anſwer to this may be gathered from the Anſwer
to the laſt Objection, And what hath been ſaid in this before to acquit
them from this Charge upon ſuch an Account. That is, that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> (as ſuch) never preſcribed any ſuch Rules, becauſe
they never met in the whole, or in their Repreſentative, to conſult about,
or agree upon any ſuch Rules, for the whole. Nor can any who have made ſuch
Rules, pretend themſelves upon any Divine, or Rational grounds to be the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and intruſted from above with any ſuch Power to
make ſuch Rules for the Churches Practice; nor are Men bound to 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:172259:49"/> uſe any thing in Gods Worſhip, or about it, not
command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf, ſo long as they ſuſpect ſuch things in
themſelves, or as they are circumſtanciated, to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; of which,
every Man muſt be his own Judge for his own Practice, becauſe it doth ſo
highly concern him, as he would pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Yet we ſhall add this further by way of Anſwer. Firſt, It is
no true Rule; therefore to Practiſe thoſe things which the generality of a
Nation do, barely becauſe they do ſo: For, we think, few will deny, that
the moſt go the broad way, the wrong way, love not, follow not Chriſts Laws
and Rules. Secondly, That the generality of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in
truth do not agree to thoſe Rules and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in the Church; but would
rather be glad that they were altered and Reformed, if the Magiſtrate would
pleaſe to permit it; which we will make out thus: Firſt, it may be taken
for granted, we judge, That the greater number of People are not ſo
ſtudious, as to inform themſelves of the true way of Ordering of
Church-Affairs and making of Miniſters; but take all upon truſt, in theſe
matters with the greateſt implicit faith that can be; what ever their
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors do in theſe Caſes, they ſubſcribe to and practiſe; do
herein as others do, or as they are enjoyned to do, or as their Worldly
Intereſt leads them. That there are others, who come not near any Churches or
Worſhip at all, who care for none of theſe things, are practical
Atheiſts, and of theſe not a few. Some again, and that a conſiderable
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber too, who are profeſſedly againſt all our ways; as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and
others, who pretend to be above all Ordinances and External Rules in theſe
Matters. So, that when all theſe are ſet apart (as being not fit to give
Sentence in the matter, nor their practice of any conſideration in this
caſe.) The number of Knowing, Serious, Conſciencious, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Chriſtians (whoſe Sentence only is worthy regard in this buſineſs) in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will be but <pb n="96" facs="tcp:172259:50"/> few. Secondly,
Of theſe few, the Major part conſent not, in heart at leaſt, it is not
their Judgment, that thoſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Rules in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> are ſo Decent, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Uſeful to Edification or tend to
Peace, as is pretended, as many (though they Actually ſubmit to them) have
open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly declared. And there are (no doubt) many more, (might they ſpeak
freely, and not be Offenders) would te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this. A conſiderable number
alſo of theſe demonſtrate their diſſent by their Sufferings for their
Non-conformity to them, and practiſing after another Rule in theſe things.
If then the Major part of the Knowing, Sober, Judicious, and Conſciencious
Chriſtians in <hi>England</hi> diſſent, How can they ſay, The Church of
<hi>England</hi> preſcribes, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands this or that? Or have agreed on, or
determined of this or that? Or that the generality of the Church agree to this,
or that, (for an Agreement muſt be a judicious Act of the mind) to ſay,
That the Rabble of Ignorant, Careleſs, and notoriouſly ſcandalous
Perſons agree to it, love it, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and contend highly for it; will
help little to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Judgment of the Church, or make her Laws va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.
And if this be ſo, Then, Thirdly, In what ſence, or by what Rule of
Reaſon can one part of the Chriſtians in <hi>England</hi> rather be called
Schiſmaticks, and Separatiſts for not agreeing with the other in theſe
things, than the other part for not agreeing with the firſt (except, at
leaſt it be in things apparently and undoubtedly Lawful, and tending to
Edification, and ſo accounted by all, that Offence cannot be given.) It can
be no way reſolved, but thus; That thoſe who are uppermoſt in outward
Power, whether one party or other, will have it ſo.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore end with the words of <hi>Tertul.</hi> in his
<hi>Apol. Chap.</hi> 39. <hi>p.</hi> 142, 143. Engliſh Tranſlation: <hi>We
Offend no body, we Injure no body: When any Vertuous or Godly People are
aſſociated, when any Pious or Chaſt Perſons Aſſemble together,
their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſhould not be called a Faction, but a Lawful Society.</hi>
